We sincerely thank the Michael Uren Foundation for their generous support in advancing this pioneering research programme. Through an enhanced understanding of microbial ecosystems, our goal is to foster sustainable agricultural practices and equip farmers with innovative tools to improve crop yields while preserving biodiversity.
Project Overview
The Microbiome Green Revolution project addresses a crucial challenge: maintaining or increasing agricultural productivity while reducing pesticide and fertilizer use, as well as lowering the carbon footprint. Our approach focuses on harnessing beneficial soil microbes to protect crops, specifically aiming to improve disease resilience in wheat—a globally important crop affected by the Take-All fungal disease (Gaeumannomyces tritici or Gt), which reduces yield by 10-20% in continuous wheat.">

Through an enhanced understanding of microbial ecosystems, our goal is to foster sustainable agricultural practices and equip farmers with innovative tools to improve crop yields while preserving biodiversity.</p>
<h3 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h3>
<p>The <strong>Microbiome Green Revolution</strong> project addresses a crucial challenge: maintaining or increasing agricultural productivity while reducing pesticide and fertilizer use, as well as lowering the carbon footprint. Our approach focuses on harnessing beneficial soil microbes to protect crops, specifically aiming to improve disease resilience in wheat—a globally important crop affected by the Take-All fungal disease (<em>Gaeumannomyces tritici</em> or Gt), which reduces yield by 10-20% in continuous wheat.</p>
<p>This interdisciplinary pipeline combines state-of-the-art modeling and empirical tools. The project’s main tasks are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Task 1</strong>: Collect agricultural soils across the UK to build a biobank of soil microbes.</li>
<li><strong>Task 2</strong>: Conduct high-throughput lab experiments to identify and predict protective microbial communities.</li>
<li><strong>Task 3</strong>: Field trials to test these protective communities on wheat crops.</li>
</ul>
<p>These tasks are supported by computational pipelines and theoretical modeling tools for comprehensive data analysis and interpretation.</p>
<h3 id="project-tasks">Project Tasks</h3>
<h4 id="task-1-build-a-biobank-from-take-all-suppressive-soils">Task 1: Build a Biobank from Take-All Suppressive Soils</h4>
<p><strong>Status:</strong> Partially complete (50%)</p>
<p>We are creating a biobank of UK soil samples, preserved at low temperatures to maintain living microbes for long-term research. Over 696 samples have been collected, each stored at 4°C (for Task 2 experiments) and -80°C (for DNA sequencing). The biobank also includes metadata on soil conditions and land management.</p>
<h4 id="task-2-artificial-selection-of-disease-suppressive-microbiomes">Task 2: Artificial Selection of Disease-Suppressive Microbiomes</h4>
<p><strong>Status:</strong> Partially complete (10%)</p>
<p>Using Task 1&rsquo;s biobank, we are selecting microbial communities that best protect against Gt. Preliminary experiments to identify optimal growing conditions are underway, with main experiments set for Winter/Spring 2025.</p>
<h4 id="task-3-test-optimized-microbiome-assembly-protocols-in-the-field">Task 3: Test Optimized Microbiome Assembly Protocols in the Field</h4>
<p><strong>Status:</strong> Not yet started</p>
<p>The microbes identified in Tasks 1 and 2 will be field-tested for disease suppression efficacy in 2025. Plans are in place for trials at Silwood Park and with Rothamsted Research.</p>
<h3 id="cross-cutting-tasks">Cross-Cutting Tasks</h3>
<h4 id="computational-pipelines">Computational Pipelines</h4>
<p><strong>Status:</strong> Partially complete (20%)</p>
<p>Bioinformatics pipelines are being developed to monitor microbial populations, compare them with wheat yield data, and identify key microbes and genes involved in wheat protection.</p>
<h4 id="development-of-theory">Development of Theory</h4>
<p><strong>Status:</strong> Partially complete (20%)</p>
<p>We are building a mathematical framework to predict Gt incidence based on field survey data and a “digital microbiome” model of soil microbiomes, expected to be complete by 2024.</p>
